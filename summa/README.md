### 3. Distributed matrix multiplication algorithm (SUMMA)

The Scalable Universal Matrix Multiplication Algorithm is a straightforward, highly efficient, scalable implementation of common matrix multiplication operations.

Implement SUMMA using MPI and compare it to a shared memory algorithm (OpenMP, OpenCLor CUDA).


NOTE: Performance analysis consists in analyzing single processor performance and, speedup, efficiency and scalability from 1 to P processorsfor the parallel versions. A *discussion* on the obtained results is also expected.

### Computing Platforms

Two computing platforms are available in the Lab:
   - PLATFORM 1: One multicoreprocessor.
   - PLATFORM 2: One or more nodes, each with a multicore Processor.
