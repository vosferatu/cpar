for(i=0; i<n;i++)                             *
    for(j=0; j <n;j++)                    switch

               C[i,j]+= A[i,k]*B[k*j]

for(k=0;k<n;k++)
      c[i,i] += A[i,k]*B[k,i]

for each k we are completing a matrix

we are transforming from an inner product to a outer product simulation

we are dividing A in smaller blocks to communicate to the others instead of communicating all the blocks
we are doing column of a block * line of a block
